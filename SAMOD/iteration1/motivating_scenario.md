# Motivating Scenario (Iteration 1)

## Name
Mentions in accademic paper 

In an academic context, a "mention" is a reference made to an entity such as a researcher, a software, a methodology, a theory, or a dataset, within an article. These mentions can be either explicit, where the mentioned entity is clearly indicated, or implicit, where the mentioned entity is deduced from the context.

To provide an example about the different characteristic of those two types of mentions:
- An explicit mention could be something like "Dr. Johnson's groundbreaking research on climate change" where the researcher is clearly named within the text itself. 
- An implicit mention might be more indirect, such as discussing "seminal studies in the field" without naming specific researchers, assuming the reader knows which studies are being referred to, either because it's implied or because they have been already mentioned before in the text.

Mentions in an academic article serve as links that connect various aspects of research. Each mention, whether it refers to a researcher, software, methodology, theory, or dataset, contributes to creating a network of knowledge.

A mention may refer to multiple entities simultaneously, establishing a relationship between them. The nature of this relationship may vary depending on the perspective. For example, a scholar might make a critical observation about a mentioned software, while another might cite a theory in an approving manner.

Example:

Let's consider a set of articles spanning from "article-1" to "article-5" and the following mentions that they contain:

Mention1: Explicit, mentions dataset-1
Mention2: Explicit, mentions methodology-1
Mention3: Explicit, mentions software-1
Mention4: Implicit, mentions person-1
Mention5: Implicit, mentions theory-1
Mention6: Explicit, mentions dataset-1 and dataset-2 (article-2)
Mention7: Implicit, mentions person-1 and person-2 (article-3)
Mention8: Explicit, mentions software-1 and software-2 (article-2 and article-3)
Mention9: Implicit, mentions theory-1, theory-2, and theory-3 (article-2, article-3 and article-4)
Mention10: Explicit, mentions methodology-1 and methodology-2 (article-3 and article- 5)
Mention11: Implicit, mentions person-1, person-2, and person-3 (article-2 and article-3)
Mention12: Explicit, mentions dataset-3 and methodology-1 (article-4 and article-5)


Given that:

Mention1 mentions dataset-1;
Mention2 mentions methodology-1;
Mention3 mentions software-1;
Mention4 mentions person-1;
Mention5 mentions theory-1;
Mention6 mentions dataset-1 and dataset-2 
Mention7 mentions person-1 and person-2
Mention8 mentions software-1 and software-2
Mention9 mentions theory-1, theory-2 and theory-3
Mention10 mentions methodology-1 and methodology-2
Mention11 mentions person-1, person-2 and person-3
Mention12 mentions dataset-3 and methodology-1

Then:

All mentions that are part of article-1 and mention dataset-1 are: Mention1
All mentions in article-1 that mentions methodology-1 are: Mention2
All mentions in article-1 that mentions software-1 are: Mention3
All mentions in article-1 that mentions person-1 are: Mention4 
All mentions in article-1 that mentions theory-1 are: Mention5
All mentions that are part of article-1 and article-2 and mention dataset-1 are: Mention6
All mentions in article-1 and article-3 that mention person-1 are: Mention7
All mentions that are part of article-2 and article-3 and mention software-1 are: Mention8
All mentions in article-1, article-2, and article-3 that mention theory-1 are: Mention9
All mentions that are part of article-1 and article-2 and mention methodology-1 are: Mention10
All mentions in article-1, article-2, and article-3 that mention person-1 are: Mention11
All mentions that are part of article-4 and article-5 and mention dataset-3 are: Mention12


## Definition of "mention"/"to mention":
### mention:
 [from the Latin mentio -onis, related to mens mentis "mind, memory", and meminisse "to remember"]. – A recollection, explicit citation of a person, a thing or an event, which is made when speaking or writing: this character (or this fact) is not mentioned in the historical sources of the time; to mention someone or something, to talk about it on purpose and often with emphasis, or simply to cite its name: the bibliography does not mention the most recent contributions on the topic; the report expressly mentions the place and time; worthy of mention, deserving to be named, to be remembered: the episode is not worth mentioning; artist, poet, work worthy of mention. In particular, honorable mention or honor, a certificate of honor that is sometimes granted to those who, in a competition for prizes, in a race and the like, are judged worthy of praise but do not win the prize at stake. In legal language, no mention of the sentence, in the criminal record certificate, a benefit that can be granted by the judge when certain prerequisites expressly provided by law exist, and which has the effect of not mentioning the conviction in the criminal record certificate issued at the request of private individuals.
