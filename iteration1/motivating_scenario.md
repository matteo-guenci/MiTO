# Motivating Scenario (Iteration 1)

## Name
Mentions in accademic paper 

In an academic context, a "mention" is a reference made to an entity such as a researcher, a software, a methodology, a theory, or a dataset, within an article. These mentions can be either explicit, where the mentioned entity is clearly indicated, or implicit, where the mentioned entity is deduced from the context.

Mentions in an academic article serve as links that connect various aspects of research. Each mention, whether it refers to a researcher, software, methodology, theory, or dataset, contributes to creating a network of knowledge.

A mention may refer to multiple entities simultaneously, establishing a relationship between them. The nature of this relationship may vary depending on the perspective. For example, a scholar might make a critical observation about a mentioned software, while another might cite a theory in an approving manner.

In summary:

- **Mentions of people**: When a researcher refers to the work of another researcher.
- **Mentions of software**: When a researcher mentions software or a tool used in their research.
- **Mentions of methodology**: When a specific methodology or approach is mentioned.
- **Mentions of theory**: When reference is made to a particular theory or concept.
- **Mentions of datasets**: When a specific dataset used in the research is mentioned.

### Example 1: The following mentions are part of article_1:

- **mention_a**: Researcher A mentions Software X
- **mention_b**: Researcher B mentions Methodology Y
- **mention_c**: Researcher C mentions Theory Z (without explicitly naming it)
- **mention_d**: Researcher D mentions Dataset Q
- **mention_e**: Researcher E mentions Researcher A and Software X
- **mention_f**: Researcher F mentions Researcher B, Methodology Y, and Dataset Q (without explicitly naming them)

**Given that:**

- **mention_a** and **mention_e** are explicit mentions of Software X
- **mention_b** and **mention_f** are explicit mentions of Methodology Y
- **mention_c** is an implicit mention of Theory Z inferred from the context (since not explicitly named)
- **mention_d** and **mention_f** are explicit mentions of Dataset Q
- **mention_e** is an explicit mention of Researcher A
- **mention_f** is an implicit mention of Researcher B inferred from the context

**Then, we can infer that:**

- All mentions in **article_1** explicitly mentioning Software X are: **mention_a**, **mention_e**
- All mentions in **article_1** explicitly mentioning Methodology Y are: **mention_b**, **mention_f**
- All mentions in **article_1** implicitly mentioning a theory are: **mention_c**
- All mentions in **article_1** explicitly mentioning a dataset are: **mention_d**, **mention_f**
- All mentions in **article_1** explicitly mentioning a researcher are: **mention_e**
- All mentions in **article_1** implicitly mentioning a researcher are: **mention_f**
