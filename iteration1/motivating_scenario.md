Mentions in accademic paper 

In an academic context, a "mention" is a reference made to an entity such as a researcher, a software, a methodology, a theory, or a dataset, within an article. These mentions can be either explicit, where the mentioned entity is clearly indicated, or implicit, where the mentioned entity is deduced from the context.

Mentions in an academic article serve as links that connect various aspects of research. Each mention, whether it refers to a researcher, software, methodology, theory, or dataset, contributes to creating a network of knowledge.

A mention may refer to multiple entities simultaneously, establishing a relationship between them. The nature of this relationship may vary depending on the perspective. For example, a scholar might make a critical observation about a mentioned software, while another might cite a theory in an approving manner.
