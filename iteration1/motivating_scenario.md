# Motivating Scenario (Iteration 1)

## Name
Mentions in accademic paper 

In an academic context, a "mention" is a reference made to an entity such as a researcher, a software, a methodology, a theory, or a dataset, within an article. These mentions can be either explicit, where the mentioned entity is clearly indicated, or implicit, where the mentioned entity is deduced from the context.

To provide an example about the different characteristic of those two types of mentions:
- An explicit mention could be something like "Dr. Johnson's groundbreaking research on climate change" where the researcher is clearly named within the text itself. 
- An implicit mention might be more indirect, such as discussing "seminal studies in the field" without naming specific researchers, assuming the reader knows which studies are being referred to, either because it's implied or because they have been already mentioned before in the text.

Mentions in an academic article serve as links that connect various aspects of research. Each mention, whether it refers to a researcher, software, methodology, theory, or dataset, contributes to creating a network of knowledge.

A mention may refer to multiple entities simultaneously, establishing a relationship between them. The nature of this relationship may vary depending on the perspective. For example, a scholar might make a critical observation about a mentioned software, while another might cite a theory in an approving manner.

Example:

Let's consider a set of articles spanning from "Article1" to "Article5" and the following mentions that they contain:

Mention1: Explicit, mentions Dataset1
Mention2: Explicit, mentions Methodology1
Mention3: Explicit, mentions Software1
Mention4: Implicit, mentions Person1
Mention5: Implicit, mentions Theory1
Mention6: Explicit, mentions Dataset1 and Dataset2 (Article2)
Mention7: Implicit, mentions Person1 and Person2 (Article3)
Mention8: Explicit, mentions Software1 and Software2 (Article2 and Article3)
Mention9: Implicit, mentions Theory1, Theory2, and Theory3 (Article2, Article3 and Article4)
Mention10: Explicit, mentions Methodology1 and Methodology2 (Article3 and Article 5)
Mention11: Implicit, mentions Person1, Person2, and Person3 (Article2 and Article3)
Mention12: Explicit, mentions Dataset3 and Methodology1 (Article4 and Article5)


Given that:

Mention1 mentions Dataset1;
Mention2 mentions Methodology1;
Mention3 mentions Software1;
Mention4 mentions Person1;
Mention5 mentions Theory1;
Mention6 mentions Dataset1 and Dataset2 
Mention7 mentions Person1 and Person2
Mention8 mentions Software1 and Software2
Mention9 mentions Theory1, Theory2 and Theory3
Mention10 mentions Methodology1 and Methodology2
Mention11 mentions Person1, Person2 and Person3
Mention12 mentions Dataset3 and Methodology1

Then:

All mentions that are part of Article1 and mention Dataset1 are: Mention1
All mentions in Article1 that mentions Methodology1 are: Mention2
All mentions in Article1 that mentions Software1 are: Mention3
All mentions in Article1 that mentions Person1 are: Mention4 
All mentions in Article1 that mentions Theory1 are: Mention5
All mentions that are part of Article1 and Article2 and mention Dataset1 are: Mention6
All mentions in Article1 and Article3 that mention Person1 are: Mention7
All mentions that are part of Article2 and Article3 and mention Software1 are: Mention8
All mentions in Article1, Article2, and Article3 that mention Theory1 are: Mention9
All mentions that are part of Article1 and Article2 and mention Methodology1 are: Mention10
All mentions in Article1, Article2, and Article3 that mention Person1 are: Mention11
All mentions that are part of Article4 and Article5 and mention Dataset3 are: Mention12


## Definition of "mention"/"to mention":
### mention:
 [from the Latin mentio -onis, related to mens mentis "mind, memory", and meminisse "to remember"]. – A recollection, explicit citation of a person, a thing or an event, which is made when speaking or writing: this character (or this fact) is not mentioned in the historical sources of the time; to mention someone or something, to talk about it on purpose and often with emphasis, or simply to cite its name: the bibliography does not mention the most recent contributions on the topic; the report expressly mentions the place and time; worthy of mention, deserving to be named, to be remembered: the episode is not worth mentioning; artist, poet, work worthy of mention.
